To create parameter files ("prep files") for a drug molecule using the AMBER9 Antechamber suite and 
RESP charge assignment, the starting point is a pdb file --- xxx_init.pdb.

Step1: Add hydrogen atoms using the PRODRG web server --- obtain xxx.pdb

Step2: Run Antechamber to generate a Gaussian geometry optimisation input file --- xxx.gau

Step3: Run Gaussian with xxx.gau as input -- this may take up to 3-4 days, or just half a day. At the end of the 
output file xxx.out the per-atom ESP charge fit is printed - this is what is used in the next step.

Step4: Run Antechamber to produce a "prep" file xxx.prepi using the xxx.out and the xxx.pdb.

Step5: Run parmcheck (also from Amber9) to produce a force field modification file for the ligand xxx.frcmod -- 
this contains connectivity information (e.g. bonds, torsion angles, etc).

Step6: Use Xleap(Amber 9) to import the prep, frcmod, and pdb files, inspect the structure for consistency and 
charge neutrality, and generate a topology file xxx.top


Sample .pdb (with H-s) .gau, .out, .prepi, .frcmod, and .top files are given for delavirdine in the directory: /sample_del
